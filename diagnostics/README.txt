1. traceplot: iteration number against the value of the draw of the parameter at each iteration. 

2. running mean plot: the iteration against the mean of the draws up to each iteration

3. autocorrelation plot: the lag k autocorrelation is the correlation between every draw and its k-th lag. 

4. effective sample size: The idea is to have a sort of “exchange rate” between dependent and independent samples. For example, that 1,000 samples from a certain Markov chain are worth about as much as 80 independent samples because the MCMC samples are highly correlated.
