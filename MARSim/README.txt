As of 8/20/2017:

-f1(Study 7): the probability of missing at each visit depends on V_{i} and Y_{it}, initial value of parameters are close to true values. 

-f2(Study 8): the probability of missing at each visit depends on age and gender, initial value of parameters are close to true values. 

-f3(Study 9): same with study 7, but initial values of parameters are not close to true values. 

-f4(Study 10):same with study 8, but initial values of parameters are not close to true values.
